# GBL-Stats
In this project I scraped the boxscores from all the games of regular season in the Stoiximan Greek Basketball League, Greece's domestic league with a Python script. Also the team stats for every game were extracted as they are necessary when calculating advanced statistics. 
Then, the data got processed through Microsoft Excel in order to get some minor cleaning that it was needed and also in order to create advanced stats through formulas and the initial stats from the boxscores. 
The advanced statistics that were calculated using the box score statistics are: True Shooting Percentage (TS%), Effective Field Goal Percentage (eFG %), Offensive & Defensive Rating, Team Pace etc. The importance of those statistics is big, as they create a ratio of equal possessions making comparisons much more fair. Thus, the conclusions we draw about both teams and players are much more targeted. To make the results easier to follow I made some data Visualizations in Tableau that give us insights for players and teams performance throughout the season.
