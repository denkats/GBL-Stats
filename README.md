# GBL-Stats
In this project I scraped the boxscores from all the games of regular season in the Stoiximan Greek Basketball League, Greece's domestic league with a Python script. The data then got processed through Microsoft Excel in order to get some minor cleaning that it was needed and also in order to create advanced stats through formulas and the initial stats from the boxscores. Finally, there are some data Visualizations in Tableau that give us insights for players and teams performance throughout the season.
